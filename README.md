# Pomodoro-Timer

This project is a simple Pomodoro Timer application which allows users to be alerted with a sound when the focus timer(the pomodoro) expires.  This is followed by a break timer which gives the user time in which they can take a break from working.

Users can change the duration of the focus time(default: 25 minutes) and the break time(default: 5 minutes). Focus duration can be as short as 5 minutes, and as long as 60 minutes. Break duration can be as short as 1 minute, and as long as 15 minutes.
